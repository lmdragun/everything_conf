== README

These are documents for a presentation for General Assembly's Everything Conf. It contains

* A Solution folder, with a Rails app setup with Self-Referential Associations

* A Starter folder, with a Rails app setup to have a Self-Referential Association added in

To properly use these, go into either the Solution or Starter folder and run bundle install, followed by rake db:creat db:migrate db:seed.
